# CSS :nth-child Selector Issue with Nested Lists

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to the use of the `:nth-child` pseudo-class in CSS when dealing with nested lists. The bug arises from a misunderstanding of how `:nth-child` interacts with the structure of nested lists.

The `bug.css` file contains the incorrect CSS code, while `bugSolution.css` provides a corrected version that addresses the issue. The problem and its solution are explained in the files themselves.
